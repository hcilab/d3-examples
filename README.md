# d3-examples
Examples for programming data-driven webpages using D3. 
Built and tested using Chrome, may not work as intended with other browsers.
If the files don't appear to be working, you may need to allow file access to your browser.
For Chrome, I created a batch file "TestChrome.bat":
  @echo off
  cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application" ::Insert your own file path to chrome application here  
  start chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
